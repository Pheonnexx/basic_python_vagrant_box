 == Basic vagrant box
 
 === What I am using this for:
 
 I have started a new project which is so far being written in python.  Numerous things will be tried, some will work, some wont and I need to have an environment that I can pull up and tear down so as not to get any conflicts.
 
 This is the first one I have put together and so far runs with a shell script for all my needs.  I am currently using a centos/puppet box with the idea that I would use puppet in the future.
